//! This module provides an implementation of the Ownable pattern for smart contracts.

//! The Ownable pattern is a common design pattern in smart contracts that allows for
//! a single owner to control the contract. This module provides a simple implementation
//! of this pattern, allowing for ownership to be transferred or renounced.
